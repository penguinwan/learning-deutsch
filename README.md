- Flashcard is being ditched! because I reckon using flashcard to memorize noun and artikel is not a very effective learning method for me. 
- The first version of flashcard displays 3 different german artikel in 3 different colors. I was hoping this would help me memorize better, but after trying for a few days, I still don't remember a thing! Then I created second version of flashcard. 
- The second version of flashcard displays 3 different artikel in 3 different color, AND each being placed at different position on the screen. This is to mimic the memorization technique related to position, where:
	- imagine Hund is in John's pocket, John is a man, so Hund is masculine
	- imagine Brille is in Lily's bag, Lily is a woman, so Brille is femanine
	- imagine Auto is in a cupboard, cupboard is neither, so Auto is neutral
	- but it still doesn't work for me!!
- Ok, ok, maybe I need a pause after a few cards, so I created the third version, there will be a pause of 5 seconds after 5 cards. And the result is still not prominent.
- Now I am trying a method that I was taught in school, REPETITION!! When I was in my primary year, I had daily homeworks bring back from school(at least 1 per subject, non-negotiable), for Chinese homework, we were given 10-15 characters each day, our work is to write each character 10 times on exercise book (that is 100 characters each day), to some this might sounds like a horrible experience, but not to the young me, that experience helps me remember all the Chinese character I learnt even until today. Let's see!
